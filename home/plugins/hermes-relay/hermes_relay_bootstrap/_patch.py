"""Import-hook plumbing + Application monkey-patch.

When `aiohttp.web` is imported anywhere in the running interpreter, our
`_AioHttpWebFinder` intercepts the import, lets the real loader finish,
then swaps `web.Application` for a `_PatchedApplication` subclass.

The subclass overrides `__setitem__` so we can detect the moment hermes-agent's
`APIServerAdapter` does `self._app["api_server_adapter"] = self` — that's the
single line in the upstream `connect()` method that gives us a reference to
the adapter while the app is still being built (router not yet frozen).

At that point, we call `_register_routes()` to bind any missing compatibility
handlers to the same router the gateway is in the middle of populating. Route
registration is granular: native upstream routes win per method/path, and the
bootstrap only fills gaps that still do not exist. The injected set is
compatibility-only — session search, memory, legacy skill detail/toggle,
config, and available-models. Sessions CRUD/messages/fork and the legacy
skill list are retired: native upstream owns them (PR #33134 / #33016) and
the bootstrap no longer carries handlers for them. We also install the
slash-command middleware that intercepts
``/v1/chat/completions`` and ``/v1/runs`` to handle gateway commands like
``/help``, ``/commands``, ``/profile``, and ``/provider`` without forwarding
them to the LLM.  The gateway then continues with its own route registrations
and starts the server normally.

Failure modes are silent-but-logged: if anything in this chain breaks
(unexpected upstream refactor, aiohttp version incompatibility, missing
SessionDB methods, etc.), we log a warning and let the gateway start without
the injected routes. The Android client's capability detection will fall back
to the standard upstream endpoints automatically.
