"""
hermes-relay plugin — registers android_* + desktop_* tools and the
`hermes pair` + `hermes relay` CLI sub-commands into hermes-agent via the
v0.3.0+ plugin system.

Drop this folder into ~/.hermes/plugins/hermes-relay and add `hermes-relay`
to `plugins.enabled` in ~/.hermes/config.yaml, then restart hermes.
Run `hermes pair` to generate a QR code for pairing clients.
