"""The Hermes agent lane: one delegate tool call becomes a run on the api_server.

Hard rule taken from the voice domain: the relay pumps audio on this loop, so a tool that
waits is a microphone that stops. Nothing here blocks the caller — submission returns a
receipt instantly and the answer arrives later, spoken, from a worker thread.

Statuses are four named outcomes, never a bare exception, because the panel has to say
which one happened: ``ok`` (usable), ``absent`` (no server reachable), ``unauthorized``
(the key is wrong — a live server that refused us), ``error`` (it answered badly).
