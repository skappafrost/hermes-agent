# Hermes-Relay Dashboard Plugin — Frontend

React UI that runs inside the hermes-agent dashboard via the upstream Plugin
SDK. It covers paired sessions, pairing QR generation, bridge activity, media
inspection, and remote-access setup. The build output (`dist/index.js`) is
**committed to git** because the dashboard `<script src=...>` loads it verbatim
— operators never run the build.

The header's **Connect mobile app** action is intentionally independent of the
Relay service. It renders a tokenless setup QR containing only
`{"dashboard_url":"<canonical dashboard base>"}` so Android can add and verify the
standard Dashboard/Gateway connection. Relay pairing remains a separate,
explicit **Pair new device** flow.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- npm 9+

Only one dev dependency: `esbuild`. No React, no tailwind, no shadcn — they all
come from the dashboard's SDK global at runtime.

## Build

```bash
cd plugin/dashboard
npm install
npm run build
```

Writes a single IIFE bundle to `dist/index.js`. Expected size: ~20-80 KB
minified. If the bundle balloons past 200 KB, investigate (likely an unintended
`import` of a heavy module — remember React/UI primitives must come from the
SDK global, not be bundled).

To iterate with rebuilds on save:

```bash
npm run watch
```

The `build.sh` wrapper is a bash entry point that runs `npm install` if
`node_modules/` is missing, then `npm run build`. Useful for git hooks.

## Regenerating the committed bundle

After any change under `src/`:

```bash
npm run build
git add dist/index.js src/
git commit -m "feat(dashboard): <what changed>"
```

CI does not rebuild the bundle. Forgetting this step means the change ships
source-only and the deployed dashboard keeps serving the old behaviour.

## SDK touch points

All runtime dependencies come from two globals the dashboard shell injects:

| Global | Used for |
|--------|----------|
| `window.__HERMES_PLUGIN_SDK__.React` | React namespace (we never bundle React) |
| `window.__HERMES_PLUGIN_SDK__.hooks` | `useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`, `useMemo` |
| `window.__HERMES_PLUGIN_SDK__.components` | shadcn primitives — `Tabs*`, `Card*`, `Table*`, `Button`, `Badge`, `Alert*`, `Switch`, `Label` |
| `window.__HERMES_PLUGIN_SDK__.fetchJSON` | Session-token-authenticated JSON fetch |
| `window.__HERMES_PLUGINS__.register(name, Component)` | Registration hook |

Every `.jsx` file opens with:

```js
const SDK = window.__HERMES_PLUGIN_SDK__;
const { React } = SDK;
const { useState, useEffect, ... } = SDK.hooks;
```

so that esbuild's classic JSX transform (`--jsx=transform
--jsx-factory=React.createElement`) resolves against the runtime React.

## Styling contract

The dashboard host injects this plugin's `dist/style.css` as a plain `<link>`.
Keep every rule scoped under `.hermes-relay-plugin` and use the host's current
theme tokens: `--color-card`, `--color-card-foreground`, `--color-foreground`,
`--color-muted-foreground`, `--color-border`, `--color-ring`,
`--color-destructive`, `--color-success`, `--color-warning`, `--radius-*`, and
`--theme-font-*`. Avoid old unprefixed shadcn aliases such as `--card` or
`--muted`; they are not part of the current dashboard plugin contract. Fixed
white/black colors are acceptable only for QR canvases and image export surfaces
where scan/read correctness requires them.

## Backend routes consumed

All proxied by `plugin_api.py` under `/api/plugins/hermes-relay/`:

- `GET /overview` — relay version, uptime, counters
- `GET /sessions` — paired device list
- `GET /bridge-activity?limit=N` — ring buffer of recent bridge commands
- `GET /media?include_expired=true|false` — MediaRegistry snapshot
- `POST /pairing` — mint a pairing code and signed QR payload
- `DELETE /sessions/{token_prefix}` — revoke a paired session
- `GET /remote-access/status` — Tailscale/public URL status
- `GET /remote-access/public-url` — read the pinned public relay URL
- `PUT /remote-access/public-url` — pin or clear the public relay URL
- `POST /remote-access/probe` — probe candidate relay endpoints
- `POST /remote-access/tailscale/enable` — enable Tailscale serving
- `POST /remote-access/tailscale/disable` — disable Tailscale serving

## Demo screenshots

A representative set when showcasing the plugin:

- Management tab with paired Android and desktop sessions
- Pairing dialog with QR code and endpoint controls
- Bridge Activity command stream
- Media Inspector token list
- Remote Access endpoint setup and probe results

## Auto-refresh cadence

| Tab | Poll interval | Notes |
|-----|---------------|-------|
| Management | 10s | `/overview` + `/sessions` |
| Activity | 5s | `/bridge-activity` |
| Media | 15s | `/media`; TTL countdown ticks every 1s independently |
| Remote Access | 15s | `/remote-access/status`; endpoint probes run on demand |

Toggle persists to `localStorage['hermes-relay-autorefresh']` (default: on).
When off, each tab surfaces a manual "Refresh" button.

## Notes

- Session revocation calls the dashboard backend's
  `DELETE /sessions/{token_prefix}` proxy route and asks for operator
  confirmation before sending the destructive request.
- Every tab handles loading / empty / error states. The error state shows the
  backend's 502 detail verbatim so "relay unreachable" is debuggable without
  opening devtools.
