"""HMAC-SHA256 signing for QR pairing payloads.

The operator runs ``hermes-pair`` (or the ``/hermes-relay-pair`` skill) on
the host. It generates a QR payload containing the API endpoint + the
relay URL + a pre-registered pairing code. A malicious LAN peer who
captures or forges a QR with a different host/code could trick a phone
into connecting to the attacker instead — so we sign the canonical form
of the payload with a host-local secret and include the signature in
the QR.

When the phone later re-scans a payload (e.g. to "import a saved QR")
we can verify the signature against the same secret. The phone does NOT
get the secret — verification is server-side only, so its value is for
the operator's own audit trail + defense against the phone trusting a
forged payload that was pasted into the QR input screen rather than
scanned off a trusted display. Phone-side verification is not currently
wired up (the brief calls for the server side only in this pass).

    * ``sig`` is stripped — the signature is taken over the *unsigned*
      payload so verification is a pure round-trip.
    * Keys are sorted recursively, whitespace is stripped, and the
      output is ASCII-escaped for maximum cross-platform stability
      (the phone parses JSON as UTF-8 but the HMAC input has to match
      exactly, so we lock down the serialization).
    * **Arrays preserve emitted order.** ``json.dumps`` with
      ``sort_keys=True`` sorts dict keys recursively but does NOT
      reorder list elements. This matters for the ``endpoints`` array
      in v3 QR payloads where ``priority`` is meaningful and position
      encodes operator intent. The v3 contract (see ADR 24 in
      ``docs/decisions.md``) locks down list order as part of the
      canonical form so ``[lan, tailscale, public]`` and
      ``[public, tailscale, lan]`` sign differently.
    * **Values are embedded verbatim with no normalization.** String
      values (notably ``role``) are not lowercased, stripped, or
      otherwise transformed — ``"LAN"`` and ``"lan"`` produce different
      canonical bytes and therefore different signatures. Non-ASCII
      role labels round-trip through ``\\uXXXX`` escaping (since
      ``ensure_ascii=True``) but remain recoverable byte-for-byte on
      both sides.

    Raises ``TypeError`` if the payload contains values that don't
    round-trip through ``json.dumps`` (e.g. ``math.inf`` — callers
    must serialize never-expiry as ``None`` or 0 before signing).
