"""
hermes-relay plugin — Android phone status tool.

Registers ``android_phone_status`` into the hermes-agent tool registry.
The tool reads the live phone state the relay maintains about the
connected Hermes-Relay Android app — battery, screen, current
foreground app, which bridge permissions have been granted, and what
safety rails are currently configured.

The agent calls this mid-conversation to decide whether it can
meaningfully call other bridge tools (e.g. ``android_tap_text``,
``android_screenshot``) before making blind calls that would just fail
with "phone not connected" or "accessibility not granted".

Permission / trust model:
  * Read-only — the tool only observes state, it never mutates anything.
  * Loopback-only — calls ``http://127.0.0.1:<RELAY_PORT>/bridge/status``
    over loopback, no bearer auth required (same trust model as
    ``/media/register``, ``/pairing/register``, ``/notifications/recent``).
  * The relay endpoint itself returns 503 when no phone has ever
    connected; we translate that into a clean
    ``{"phone_connected": false}`` envelope so the LLM can render it
    as natural language instead of a stack trace.
