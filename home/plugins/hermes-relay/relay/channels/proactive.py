"""Proactive channel handler — agent ↔ phone, two-way.

The mirror image of :mod:`plugin.relay.channels.bridge`. Where the bridge
carries server→phone *commands* that await a phone *response*, this channel
carries server→phone *messages* that the agent initiates. The outbound leg
(``phone.message``) is fire-and-forget; the inbound leg (``proactive.reply``,
Phase 2c) carries the user's answer back so the conversation continues.

Flow (outbound — agent → phone):
  1. Phone connects to the relay's ``/ws`` and authenticates normally.
  2. When the user has "Let Hermes message me" enabled, the app sends a
     ``proactive.subscribe`` envelope. :meth:`handle` latches that phone's
     WebSocket and acks with ``proactive.subscribed``.
  3. The agent calls ``send_message(target="phone", ...)`` → the plugin's
     phone platform adapter POSTs loopback to the relay's ``/phone/message``
     route → the HTTP handler calls :meth:`push`.
  4. :meth:`push` sends a ``phone.message`` envelope over the latched
     phone WebSocket. The app raises a notification / inbox entry. If no phone
     is subscribed, :meth:`push` instead *buffers* the message (bounded,
     drop-oldest, stale-pruned) and :meth:`_flush_outbound` delivers it on the
     next ``proactive.subscribe`` — so an answer to a backgrounded phone is
     queued, not lost. A queued message can be cancelled (``cancel_outbound``)
     or inspected (``peek_outbound``) before it flushes.

Flow (inbound — phone → agent, Phase 2c):
  5. The user replies (notification inline-reply or inbox reply box). The app
     sends a ``proactive.reply`` envelope over the same WS. :meth:`handle`
     buffers it via :meth:`enqueue_reply`.
  6. The phone platform adapter — running in the *separate gateway process* —
     long-polls the relay's loopback ``GET /phone/replies`` route, which calls
     :meth:`take_replies`. Each drained reply is turned into an inbound
     ``MessageEvent`` the agent processes on the ``phone`` platform; its answer
     rides the existing outbound ``send()`` back to the phone.

The buffer + poll mirror the existing outbound loopback hop (``POST
/phone/message``) reversed: the relay and the gateway adapter are different
processes, so a reply can't be handed over in-process — it is parked in a
bounded buffer the adapter drains.

Opt-in is enforced structurally: the relay can only push when it holds a
latched ``phone_ws``, and it only gets one when the app subscribes — which
the app does only when the user toggle is on. Combined with the server-side
``PHONE_ENABLED`` gate on the adapter, both sides must opt in. Replies are
only produced by the same authenticated phone over its already-paired WS.

Wire envelopes (frozen — do not rename fields):
  * ``proactive.subscribe``   — app → server: ``{}`` (latch this phone)
  * ``proactive.subscribed``  — server → app: ``{ts}`` (ack)
  * ``proactive.unsubscribe`` — app → server: ``{}`` (release)
  * ``phone.message``         — server → app: ``{message_id, chat_id, text,
      title, surfacing, reply_to, metadata, sent_at, queued_delivery?}``
      (``queued_delivery=true`` only when this message is a reconnect flush)
  * ``proactive.backlog.complete`` — server → app: ``{count, ts}`` after a
      reconnect flush completes, so clients can show one summary for the batch
  * ``proactive.reply``       — app → server: ``{text, chat_id, reply_to,
      message_id, ts}`` (the user's answer to a ``phone.message``;
      ``reply_to`` is the answered message's id, ``chat_id`` the conversation)
  * ``proactive.reply.ack``   — server → app: ``{client_msg_id, status, ts}``
      (per-reply ack: confirms the relay buffered the user's reply for the
      gateway poller, so the app can settle its optimistic "Sending…" bubble)
  * ``proactive.cancel``      — app → server: ``{message_id}`` (drop a queued
      outbound ``phone.message`` before it flushes; the WS-reachable twin of
      ``DELETE /phone/outbound``)

Concurrency model:
  * A single ``ProactiveChannel`` instance lives on :class:`RelayServer`.
  * One phone is expected at a time (single-client, like the bridge). If a
    second phone subscribes it wins ``self.phone_ws``; the previous one
    simply stops receiving pushes.
  * The reply buffer is a bounded deque drained by a single loopback poller
    (the gateway adapter). All access is on the relay's asyncio loop, so no
    locking is required.

        — the phone never sends one, but a malformed client shouldn't wake the
        gateway poller for nothing. The buffered shape is normalized so the
        adapter sees a stable record regardless of which app version sent it.

        Returns the normalized reply (including the resolved ``message_id``) so
        the caller can ack it, or ``None`` when the reply was dropped.
